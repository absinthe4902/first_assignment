--------------------------------

**My frist assignment in DNX.** 
What I have to do is making a very simple login session. 
When I insert correct id and pw, then the program will call REST API to get a response. 
After that, I have to print all of the information in the response message. 

### Key point 
* Using REST api
* Using retrofit
